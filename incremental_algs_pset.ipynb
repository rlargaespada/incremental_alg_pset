    "In this problem set, you will implement the ARA* algorithm, an anytime heuristic search that tunes its performance bound based on available search time. The algorithm begins by finding a suboptimal solution quickly using a loose bound and then progressively tightens the bound until time runs out. With enough time, it finds a provably optimal solution. In addition, while improving its bound, ARA* reuses previous search efforts, which makes it significantly more efficient."
