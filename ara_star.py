    CLOSED : set[State]
        set of States which have been expanded
    INCONS : set[State]
        set of locally inconsistent States which have been previously expanded
    PARENTS : dict[State, State]
        dict mapping each expanded State to its predecessor State in the graph
    alg_history : dict[float, List[ARAStar_State]]
        dict mapping an epsilon value to a list of ARAStar_State objects,

        its search.
    paths_found : dict[float, List[State]]
        dict mapping epsilon values to the final paths returned for that
        epsilon. Path is represented as a list of States, start to goal.
